# Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)

An abstract syntax tree is nothing more than a simplified, condensed version of a parse tree. It is used interchangeably
with a syntax tree. 

It contains information related to analyzing the source text, and ignores extra syntactic information used for 
parsing text.
