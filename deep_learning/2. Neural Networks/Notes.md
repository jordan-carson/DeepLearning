#### Maximum Likelihood

Method: We pick the model that gives the existing 
labels the highest probability. Thus, by maximizing the
probability we can pick the best possible model.

We need a function that turns products into sums. Logs do, and this is 
used rather than using products. 

**Cross Entropy**
$$ \log_b(xy) = \log_bx + \log_by $$

 h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x
 
**Product Rule**
