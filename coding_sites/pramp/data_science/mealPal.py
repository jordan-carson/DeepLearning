# You’re a data scientist at MealPal and the customer service department wants your help measuring their team’s performance. How would you go about this?
#
# If your peer isn’t familiar with the product or company, share some info about the company: “MealPal offers lunch and dinner subscriptions giving you access to the best restaurants for less than $6 per meal.”
# Make sure to read our Interviewer Guide. While you’re at it, you should read our Interviewee and Interview Structure guides to increase you own chances of acing your interview.
# Make sure your peer identifies the goals of MealPal’s customer service team before determining what metrics to evaluate. For example, this team might be concerned with customer satisfaction.
# Your peer should then determine a metric to evaluate. If the team is concerned with customer satisfaction, one metric might be average user lifetime value (LTV).
# Now for the data, you may decide to pull data from the last 6-12 months and take all customer service tickets.
# Have your peer pick a model for how to solve the problem. For example, they may make it into a binary problem – defining tickets as 1 if the user continued using the service in the 6 months after submitting a ticket, otherwise the value is 0. They could use NLP to extract info from user-customer service text interaction (sentiment analysis). Then build a model to predict the binary variable.
# Make sure your peer considers possible output scenarios of what the model may show.
# As a conclus ion, have them determine the next steps they’d suggest for MealPal’s customer service department to improve.
